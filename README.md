#### The purpose of this repo is to organize code challenges I complete. Each challenge with have the original problem statement, a link to the test file, and a link to my solution.

  <summary>Directions Reducer</summary>
  
   #### Problem Statement: 
   `Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).`

  <summary>String Compression</summary>
      
   #### Problem Statement: 
   `Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the 'compressed' string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters.`

  <summary>Payload Target</summary>
      
   #### Problem Statement: 
   ```
Write a method that takes two parameters, payload and target. Search through a payload of unique integer values (positive, negative, or 0) to find any two numbers that add together to equal the target (which could also be positive or negative or 0).

When you find a set of numbers that add up to your target value, you can stop processing.

If found, return an array of those two values, otherwise return an empty array if no matching values are found.

For example, if your payload of numbers contained a 10 and a 5 you could return those numbers if your target was 15. Likewise, if you had -3 and 18, those would also add together to be a target of 15.

Be careful that you don't find the same number twice in your payload; for example if your payload contains a 4 and your target is 8, your answer should not indicate that it found 4 twice.

Solve this any way you can, then optimize to run in O(n) time and 1x space complexity.

  <summary>Roman Numeral To Integer</summary>
      
   #### Problem Statement: 
   `Write a recursive function that converts an integer into a string such that the number is represented in Roman Numerals in the most efficient way.
eg, the number 4 could be written as 'IIII' but it's more efficient to use 'IV' since that's a shorter string
Assume no number is greater than 4,000
Here are the Roman Numeral equivalents you'll need to know:
M=1000, CM=900, D=500, CD=400,
C=100, XC=90, L=50, XL=40,
X=10, IX=9, V=5, IV=4, I=1 `

  <summary>Snail</summary>
      
   #### Problem Statement: 
   `Given an n x n array, write a method that returns the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.`
   ```ruby
const array_matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
];

snail(array_matrix) 
#=> [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
```
